# codecov

`codecov` is a tool for converting [hpc](hackage.haskell.org/package/hpc) coverage into a form that codecov can understand. This tool is designed to be (stack)[https://docs.haskellstack.org/]-friendly and work with the latest [GHC LTS on stackage](https://www.stackage.org). If you face any problem to use this with the latest GHC LTS, feel free to put an issue on the [github issue](https://github.com/Ailrun/haskell-codecov/issues).

## Usage

Here are example setups for CircleCI and TravisCI, but the tool should work with other CIs too. If it's not, please post an issue.
